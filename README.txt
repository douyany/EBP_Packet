README about EBP Packets database:

This database captures the information from the packets sent to EBP providers participating in the Child Welfare Demonstration Project.

Some forms are completed only at the initial session or at the final session.
Other forms are completed multiple times during the course of treatment.

The queries and reports were created to the specifications of a team member to meet data tracking needs.
(The data in the spreadsheet is simulated data (later deleted about format of reports was acceptable).)
